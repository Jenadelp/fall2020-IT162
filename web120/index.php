 <p>My name is Jena. I am pursuing a certificate at Seattle Central College in Web Development and hope to gain the skills necessary to begin a career as a Web Developer. In addition, I’m planning to enroll in design courses to broaden my skillset and improve upon the aesthetics of my work.</p>
 <p>In my previous careers, I’ve worked in the service industry and as a childcare provider. I have a Bachelor’s of Art in Sociology, which I haven’t really put to use. I am fascinated with all things nutrition, health, and bio-chem related. When I’m not consumed with my schoolwork, I’m likely listening to health-related podcasts or reading about or discussing new biohacking tricks. </p>
 <p>I’m also a decent cook, enjoy a good hike, and like to unwind with some online shopping while I snuggle with my big furry cat, Meeks.</p>
